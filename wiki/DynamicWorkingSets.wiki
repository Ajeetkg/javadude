=Dynamic Working Sets for Eclipse.=

= Introduction =

Working sets are a great way to organize your projects in eclipse. However, it's up to you to add/move/remove projects.

= Installation =

You can grab the dynamic working sets feature at

If you're not sure how to use the Eclipse Update Manager open the Eclipse Help->Help Contents, and read the section under
 
Workbench User Guide->Tasks->Updating Features with the update Manager->Installing new features with the update manager.

Choose "JavaDude Automated Working Sets Feature" under "Dynamic Working Sets"

So before you create a dynamic working set, you must turn it off:
