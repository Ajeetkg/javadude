=Dynamic Working Sets for Eclipse.=

= Introduction =

Working sets are a great way to organize your projects in eclipse. However, it's up to you to add/move/remove projects.

I was working with a group, and whenever we checked different groups of projects out, we'd have to do the old "drag 'em into the working sets" dance.

I got tired of this, and dynamic working sets were born.

Dynamic working sets automatically manage their contents based on regular expressions or project natures. Nifty! The eclipse API never ceases to amaze me!
